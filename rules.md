# Rules of the Road

1.	You must have Meetup and video conferencing accounts to participate, no anonymous attendees. “Zoom bombing” will not be tolerated and your account will be reported to the provider if that happens.
2.	Video participation is emphatically encouraged. It is hard to work as a team without the visual cues of your team members.
3.	Be respectful of your fellow group members. Any disrespectful action will not be tolerated, and you will be removed.
4.	The direction we take is usually dictated by the majority, although the group moderator and group champions reserved the right to override that. You may not always agree with other folks, but this is how the professional world functions. Please respect that and treat everything as a learning and growing experience!
