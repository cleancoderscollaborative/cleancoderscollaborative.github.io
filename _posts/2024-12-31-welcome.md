Hello, and welcome to Clean Coders Collaborative!
We are an open meetup that promotes using primciples, patterns, best practices and other tools to build better software.

You can find out more by visiting our [About Page](https://cleancoderscollaborative.github.io/about).

We have chat channels on our Discord server for collaboration and questions outside of the regular meetups.
And, we encourage our members to contribute articles to this blog!
Just contact one of the organizers with your submission and we'll take care of it.
