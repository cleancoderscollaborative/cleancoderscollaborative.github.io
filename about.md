Our goal is to spread and apply the ideas of “Clean Code” to build better software.
The focus is on the application of design principles and patterns, test-driven development,
designing applications with security, and a touch of DevOps/DevSecOps (development operations)
and Agile methodologies.
Credit for the name “Clean Code” goes to Robert C. “Uncle Bob” Martin.
While you may have your own opinion about Uncle Bob, he did coin the name, and catalog and present many of the principles,
patterns, and ideas that are argued about in this forum.
But these tools were discovered, developed, and explored in parallel and collaboratively by many engineers over many decades,
some of whom have gathered no accolades, are still active, and even participate in this group!
Entering 2025 Clean Coders Collaborative moves from a focus on mobile programming to all platforms,
and from a focus of analyzing Uncle Bob’s videos to a diversified approach: 

1.	The principal format will be mob and pair programming focused on “are we building clean code?” while developing a project over several meetups.
2.	Members may ask for a code review of their own projects and that can be the topic of a particular meetup.
3.	Occasionally the focus of a particular meetup may be a video or a guest presenter!

This is not a basic coding class. We expect participant experience understanding the basic concepts of programming: variables, conditionals, loops, functions, and a bit of OOP.
Whatever the format, raise your voice! Group participation is required!  None of this is a lecture or “do as I say” presented “by the experts”. And of course, sponsors are always welcome :smile:
