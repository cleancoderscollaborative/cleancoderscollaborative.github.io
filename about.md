Credit for the name “Clean Code” goes to Robert C. “Uncle Bob” Martin.
While you may have your own opinion about Uncle Bob, he did coin the name, and catalog and present many of the principles,
patterns, and ideas that are argued about in this forum.
But these tools were discovered, developed, and explored in parallel and collaboratively by many engineers over many decades,
some of whom have gathered no accolades, are still active, and even participate in this group!
As we enter 2025 Clean Coders Collaborative will focus on programming for all platforms,
and from a focus of analyzing Uncle Bob’s videos to a diversified approach: 

1.	The principal format will be mob and pair programming focused on “are we building clean code?” while developing a project over several meetups.
2.	Members may ask for a code review of their own projects and that can be the topic of a particular meetup.
3.	Occasionally the focus of a particular meetup may be a video or a guest presenter!

This is not basic coding. We expect participant experience understanding the basic concepts of programming: variables, conditionals, loops, functions, and a bit of OOP.
Whatever the format, raise your voice! Group participation is required!  None of this is a lecture or “do as I say” presented “by the experts”. And of course, sponsors are always welcome :smile:
