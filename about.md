Clean Coders Collaborative explores the application of design principles and patterns to build
reliable, adaptable, and maintainable software applications (RAM).
Credit for the moniker “Clean Code” goes to Robert C. “Uncle Bob” Martin,
who cataloged and presented many of the principles,
patterns, and ideas that we have animated discussions about.
Uncle Bob said he got the idea to catalog and advance these principles after reading about Barbara Liskov's work.
All of these principles and patterns were discovered, developed, and explored in parallel and collaboratively
by many computer scientists and software engineers, over many decades.
Some of those engineers have gathered no accolades, are still active, may even participate in this group!
As we enter 2025 Clean Coders Collaborative will focus on the aspects of building better software for all platforms
using a devirsified approach in our meetups:

1.	Mob and pair programming focused on “are we building clean code?” while developing a project over several meetups.
We expect folks to join projects in the middle, so do not worry if you come late to the party!
2.	Members may ask for a code review of their own projects and that can be the topic of a meetup.
3.	Occasionally a meetup may be a video or a guest presenter!

This is not basic coding, we expect experience with concepts from procedural, functional, or object-oriented programming.
Whatever the format, raise your voice! Group participation is required!
None of this is a lecture or “do as I say” presented “by the experts”.
And of course, sponsors are always welcome :smile:
