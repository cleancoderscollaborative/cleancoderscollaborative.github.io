## Meetup

If you have an idea for meetup: code, video, or presentation, then let us know!
We are flexible about what we do, and are always willing to look at a project you
champion, do a peer review of your own project, watch and discuss a video participants want to analyze,
or host a presentation that is of interest to our members.

## Blog

As long as it is about building software, then we welcome your submissions to our blog!
The blog is hosted at github.io and built using Jekyll.
Submissions may be created using Markdown or Liquid.
